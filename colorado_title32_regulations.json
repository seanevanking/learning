(b)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to health service districts. (c)  The provisions of this section shall not apply in the event that the territory described\nin the petition for exclusion constitutes the entire territory of the special district. (2)  Subject to the provisions of subsection (5) of this section, the court shall hold a\nhearing on the petition and order the territory described in the petition or any portion thereof\nexcluded from the special district if the following conditions are met: (a)  The governing body of the municipality agrees, by resolution, to provide the service\nprovided by the special district to the area described in the petition on and after the effective date\nof the exclusion order.

If the municipality and the special district\nagree upon a single plan and enter into a contract incorporating its provisions, the court shall\nreview such contract, and if it finds the contract to be fair and equitable, the court shall approve\nthe contract and incorporate its provisions into its exclusion order. The court's review of the\nprovisions of the contract shall include, but not be limited to, consideration of the amount of the\nspecial district's outstanding bonds, the discharge by the municipality or the territory excluded\nfrom the special district of that portion of the special district's indebtedness incurred to serve the\nterritory proposed for exclusion, the fair market value and source of special district facilities\nlocated within the territory proposed for exclusion, the facilities to be transferred which are\nnecessary to serve the territory proposed for exclusion, the adequacy of the facilities retained by\nthe special district to serve the remaining territory of the special district, the availability of the\nfacilities transferred to the municipality for use, in whole or in part, in the remaining territory of\nthe special district, the effect which the transfer of the facilities and assumption of indebtedness\nwill have upon the service provided by the special district in territory which is not part of the\nexclusion, and the extent to which the exclusion reduces the services or facilities or increases the\ncosts to users in the remaining territory of the special district.

(b)  If an election in a water, sanitation, or water and sanitation district or a metropolitan\ndistrict providing water or sanitation services or both has been held pursuant to subsection (7) of\nthis section and the majority of votes cast favor the municipality providing the service, the\nmunicipality and such district shall enter into a contract for the municipality to assume full\nresponsibility for the operation and maintenance of the entire system or systems of such district\nand to integrate said system or systems with those of the municipality to the largest extent\npossible. The terms and conditions of service and the rates to be charged by the municipality for\nsaid service under the contract shall be uniform with the terms, conditions, and rates for similar\nservice provided by said municipality to other users within the municipality.

The order for exclusion shall\nrecite in the findings a description of any bonded indebtedness in existence immediately\npreceding the effective date of the order for which the excluded property is liable and the date\nthat such bonded indebtedness is then scheduled to be retired. After July 1, 1993, failure of the\norder for exclusion to recite the existence and scheduled retirement date of such indebtedness,\nwhen due to error or omission by the special district, shall not constitute grounds for correction\nof the omission of a levy on the excluded property from the assessment roll pursuant to section\n39-5-125, C.R.S.

(b)  If a majority of the electors voting at such election approve the question requiring the\nmunicipality to provide such service, the court shall request the governing body of the\nmunicipality and the board to enter into a contract which will govern the providing of the\nservice. The terms and conditions of the contract shall be reviewed and approved by the court,\nbut in no event shall the terms, rates, and conditions be less equitable than for services supplied\nby a municipality to any other users within the municipality. The court's review of the contract\nor, if the municipality and the special district after good faith negotiations are unable to agree\nupon a contract, the court's order shall be in accordance with the criteria set forth in paragraphs\n(b), (c), and (d) of subsection (2) of this section.

(b)  Two or more special districts may consolidate one or more of their services whether\nor not they were originally organized for the same purpose and whether or not such districts are\ncontiguous. (2)  Consolidation may be accomplished in the following manner: (a)  The board of any special district shall pass a consolidation resolution declaring that\nsuch district and any specified special district or districts are so situated that all such districts\nmay operate or that one or more specified services of each of the districts may be operated\neffectively and economically as a consolidated district and that the public health, safety,\nprosperity, and general welfare of the inhabitants of the special district initiating the\nconsolidation will be better served by the consolidation of such districts or services. The\nresolution shall also state the proposed name of the proposed consolidated district, the special\ndistricts or services to be included within the proposed consolidated district, whether the board\nof the consolidated district will have five or seven directors, any special conditions that may\nattach to the consolidated district, and the time limit within which the included special districts\nmust approve the consolidation resolution in order to be included within the proposed\nconsolidated district. Such time limit shall be not later than six months after the date of such\nresolution. (b)  After receipt of such consolidation resolution and prior to the time limit fixed in the\nconsolidation resolution, the board of each of the special districts named in the resolution\nproposing the consolidation, other than the special district initiating the proposed consolidation,\nshall pass a resolution either concurring in the consolidation or rejecting the same and shall send\na copy of such resolution to the special district initiating the consolidation. (c)  Each special district desiring to be included or have its service or services included\nwithin the consolidated district shall file the concurring resolution with the initiating special\ndistrict. If one or more special districts sought to be included in the initiating resolution file\nconcurring resolutions stating that such consolidated district will promote the public health,\nsafety, prosperity, and general welfare of the inhabitants within the concurring special districts,\nthe initiating special district, within thirty days after the date of the receipt of all concurring\nresolutions, shall file with the board of county commissioners of each county having territory\nwithin one or more of the districts and in the court wherein the organization petition of the\ninitiating special district was filed a copy of such consolidation resolution and the concurring\nresolutions of the other special districts seeking consolidation of the districts or the specified\nservices. Any proposed consolidated district which is subject to the provisions of part 2 of this\narticle pursuant to section 32-1-607 (6) shall first obtain approval of the service plan in\naccordance with the provisions of part 2 of this article. Any special district rejecting the\nconsolidation resolution shall not thereafter be included in any consolidation proceedings then\npending. (d)  When the consolidation resolution and one or more concurring resolutions are filed\nin court, the court shall fix a date, not less than thirty days nor more than forty days after the date\nof filing, within which time a hearing shall be held to determine the legality of the proposed\nconsolidation. Notice of the filing of the resolutions and of the date fixed for hearing objections\nto the proposed consolidation shall be given by publication, and written notice shall be provided\nto the governing body of any municipality entitled to notice pursuant to section 32-1-607 (6).

If all or part of the outstanding bonded\nindebtedness of all of the consolidating special districts is to be assumed by the consolidated\ndistrict, the court shall also order that the eligible electors vote separately on the question of\nconsolidation and the question of assuming the indebtedness at the consolidation election. If the\neligible electors approve consolidation but reject the assumption of indebtedness by the\nconsolidated district, the outstanding bonded indebtedness shall remain the obligation of the\nspecial district which incurred the bonded indebtedness and shall be paid and discharged by the\ntaxpayers having taxable property within the boundaries of the indebted special district. If a\npreconsolidation agreement provides that the consolidation shall be contingent upon assumption\nof debt by the consolidated district, then the consolidation shall not be approved unless the\nassumption of indebtedness is approved by the eligible electors. If any financial obligation of\none or more of the consolidating districts is to be submitted to the electors for approval as debt,\nthe court shall also order that the electors vote separately on the question of consolidation and\nthe question of approval of each financial obligation as debt, which issue shall be presented to\nthe electors in accordance with section 32-1-606.5. If the electors approve consolidation but do\nnot approve the treatment of one or more financial obligations as debt, the financial obligations\nnot so approved shall be assumed by the consolidated district in the same manner as other\nobligations of consolidating districts are assumed, unless a preconsolidation agreement providing\nthat the consolidation shall be contingent upon the approval regarding treatment of the financial\nobligation as debt, in which case the consolidation shall not be approved. The area of the\nconsolidated district after the election shall be the total area of the special districts consolidated\nexisting as of the date of the court order. No appeal shall lie from any orders of the court. (f)  Approval by a majority of the eligible electors voting in the election within each of\nthe consolidating special districts concerning the consolidation of the special districts or\nspecified services shall be deemed to conclusively establish the consolidated district against all\npersons except the state of Colorado which, within thirty-five days after the election, may\ncontest the consolidation or the election in an action in the nature of a writ of quo warranto.\nOtherwise, the consolidation of the districts or services and the organization of the consolidated\ndistrict shall not directly or indirectly be questioned in any action or proceeding. (3)  Any proceeding for consolidation undertaken pursuant to this section which is not\napproved shall not operate as a bar to any subsequently proposed consolidation of one or more of\nthe special districts or services named in the consolidation resolution with any other special\ndistrict or with each other. The provisions of section 32-1-106 shall not apply to any\nsubsequently proposed consolidation."

(b)  Such service charges may be charged to and collected in advance or otherwise by a\ndistrict from any municipality within the district and by any municipality from any person\ncontracting for such connection or use or services or from the owner or occupant, or both of\nthem, of any real property which directly or indirectly is or has been or will be connected with\nthe sewer system or from which or on which originates or has originated sewage or other wastes\nwhich directly or indirectly have entered or may enter the sewage disposal system and sewer\nsystem, and the municipality or owner, or occupant, of any such real property shall be liable for\nand shall pay such service charges to the district or municipality fixing the service charges at the\ntime when and place where such service charges are due and payable. (c)  Such service charges of any district may accrue from any date on which its board\nreasonably estimates, in any resolution authorizing the issuance of any securities or other\ninstrument appertaining thereto or in any contract with any municipality, that any sewage\ndisposal system or project being acquired or improved and equipped will be available for service\nor use. (2) (a)  Such rents, rates, fees, tolls, and other charges, being in the nature of use or\nservice charges, shall, as nearly as the district or municipality fixing the service charges shall\ndeem practicable and equitable, be reasonable, and shall be uniform throughout the district or\nmunicipality for the same type, class, and amount of use or service of the sewage disposal\nsystem or sewer system, and may be based or computed either: On measurements of sewage\nflow devices duly provided and maintained by the district or by the municipality or any user as\napproved by the district or municipality fixing such charges, and analyses of sewage samples\nprocured and made by or in a manner approved by the district; or on the consumption of water in\nor on or in connection with the municipality or real property, making due allowance for\ncommercial use of water and infiltration of groundwater and discharge of surface run-off to the\nsewer system; or on the number and kind of water outlets on or in connection with the\nmunicipality or real property, or on the number and kind of plumbing or sewage fixtures or\nfacilities in or on or in connection with the municipality or real property; or on the number of\npersons residing or working in or on or otherwise connected or identified with the municipality\nor real property, or on the capacity of the improvements in or on or connected with the\nmunicipality or real property; or upon the availability of service or readiness to serve by the\nsystem; or on any other factors determining the type, class, and amount of use or service of the\nsewage disposal system or sewer system; or on any combination of any such factors, and may\ngive weight to the characteristics of the sewage and other wastes and any other special matter\naffecting the cost of treatment and disposal thereof, including chlorine demand, biochemical\noxygen demand, concentration of solids, and chemical composition. (b)  Reasonable penalties may be fixed for any delinquencies, including, without limiting\nthe generality of the foregoing, interest on delinquent service charges from any date due at a rate\nof not exceeding one percent per month, or fraction thereof, reasonable attorneys' fees, and other\ncosts of collection. (3)  The district or municipality fixing the service charges shall prescribe and, from time\nto time, when necessary revise a schedule of such service charges, which shall comply with the\nterms of any contract of the district or municipality fixing the service charges, and in any event\nshall be such that the revenues from the service charges of the district or municipality will at all\ntimes be adequate, except to the extent that the proceeds of any general ad valorem tax or other\nmoneys are available and used, after an allowance is made for delinquencies accrued and\nreasonably estimated to accrue by the board or governing body fixing the service charges, for the\npayment of such service charges, whether resulting from any delinquency of any municipality,\nother public body, or other person, or from any other cause: (a)  To pay all expenses of operation and maintenance of the sewage disposal system or\nsewer system, including reserves, insurance, and improvements; (b)  To pay punctually the principal of and interest on any securities payable from\nrevenues of the sewage disposal system or sewer system and issued or to be issued by the district\nor municipality fixing the service charges; (c)  To maintain such reserves or sinking funds therefor; and (d)  For the payment of any expenses incidental to any sewage disposal system or sewer\nsystem or any project authorized in this part 5, any contingencies, acquisitions, improvements,\nand equipment, and any other cost, as may be required by the terms of any contract of, or as may\nbe deemed necessary or desirable by, the district or municipality fixing the service charges. (4)  Said schedule shall thus be prescribed and from time to time revised by the district or\nmunicipality. A public hearing thereon may be, but is not required to be, held by the district or\nmunicipality at least seven days after such published notice is given, as the district or\nmunicipality may determine to be reasonable. The district or municipality shall fix and\ndetermine the times when and the places where such service charges shall be due and payable\nand may require that such service charges shall be paid in advance for a period of not more than\none year. A copy of such schedule of service charges in effect shall at all times be kept on file at\nthe principal office of the district or municipality fixing the service charges and shall at all\nreasonable times be open to public inspection. (5)  The legislature has determined and declared that the obligations arising from time to\ntime of any municipality or person to pay service charges fixed in connection with any sewage\ndisposal system or sewer system shall constitute general obligations of the municipality or\nperson charged with their payment; but as such obligations accrue for current services and\nbenefits from and use of any such system, the obligations shall not constitute an indebtedness of\nthe municipality or other public body within the meaning of any constitutional, charter, or\nstatutory limitation or other provision restricting the incurrence of any debt. (6)  No board, agency, bureau, commission, or official, other than the board of the district\nor the governing body of the municipality fixing the service charges, has authority to fix,\nprescribe, levy, modify, supervise, or regulate the making of service charges, nor to prescribe,\nsupervise, or regulate the performance of services appertaining to a sewage disposal system or\nsewer system, as authorized in this part 5; but this subsection (6) shall not be construed to be a\nlimitation on the contracting powers of the board of any district or the governing body of any\nmunicipality within the district."

(3)  Securities may be issued with privileges for conversion or registration, or both, for\npayment as to principal or interest, or both; and where interest accruing on the securities is not\nrepresented by interest coupons, the securities may provide for the endorsing of payments of\ninterest thereof; and the securities generally shall be issued in such manner, in such form, either\ncoupon or registered, with such recitals, terms, covenants and conditions, and with such other\ndetails, as may be provided by the board in the resolution authorizing the securities, or other\ninstrument appertaining thereto, except as otherwise provided in this part 5. (4)  Any resolution authorizing the issuance of securities or any other instrument\nappertaining thereto may provide for their reissuance in other denominations in negotiable or\nnonnegotiable form and otherwise in such manner and form as the board may determine.

If a court so finds, it shall\nremand the matter to the board for further proceedings, consistent with such findings. (6) (a)  Where all outstanding bonds of a local improvement district have been paid and\nany moneys remain to the credit of such district, they shall be transferred to a special surplus and\ndeficiency fund, and whenever there is a deficiency in any local improvement district fund to\nmeet the payments of outstanding bonds and interest due thereon, the deficiency shall be paid\nout of said surplus and deficiency fund.

    "title": "Transportation expansion plan - utility relocation - legislative\ndeclaration - definitions.",
    "content": " (1)  The general assembly hereby finds and declares that: (a)  The district has been authorized to construct a transportation expansion plan adopted\nby the board and approved by the voters on November 2, 2004. The transportation expansion\nplan anticipates that construction will be completed on all fixed guideway corridors in a\ntwelve-year period. (b)  The scheduling and timely performance of the transportation expansion plan partially\ndepends on coordination with utility companies for the prompt performance of utility relocation\nwork necessitated by construction of the transportation expansion plan. (c)  Increased coordination between the district and utility companies is in the public\ninterest, and prompt performance of utility relocation work within the adopted plan schedule will\nreduce delays and costs of construction. Utility relocation work shall be undertaken in a manner\nthat minimizes the relocation cost and the disruption of utility services. (2) (a)  The district shall negotiate with any affected utility company in each fixed\nguideway corridor. In coordination with the district, each utility company shall determine\nwhether a district contractor or the utility company shall be responsible for the relocation of its\nutility facilities. In making such a determination, the utility company shall take into\nconsideration the location of the utility facilities, complexity of the relocation, and timing of the\nneed for relocation work. (b)  The district and the utility company shall make such arrangements for funding utility\nrelocations as are specified in the easements, licenses, franchises, or other property interests and\nrights of use held by the district or the utility company. Nothing in this section is intended to\nalter existing property agreements, licenses, or other interests of the district and utility company\nregarding the obligation to pay for utility relocation. (3) (a)  The district may enter into fixed guideway corridor utility relocation agreements\nwith a utility company. Such agreements shall be for the performance of all services required to\nassure timely relocation of utilities according to the most current written standards and practices\nestablished by the utility company at the time the agreement is entered into, unless other\nstandards are mutually selected by the district and the utility company. (b)  A fixed guideway corridor utility relocation agreement shall include a schedule for\ndesign, review, dispute resolution, and construction. (c) (I)  A fixed guideway corridor utility relocation agreement may provide for a utility\ncompany betterment, including, but not limited to, increased capacity and extensions of services;\nexcept that a betterment shall not materially delay project construction and shall be at the\nexpense of the utility company. (II)  As used in this section, \"betterment\" means any upgrade of the utility facility being\nrelocated that is not attributable to project construction and is made solely for the benefit of and\nat the election of the utility. (d)  A fixed guideway corridor utility relocation agreement may incorporate reasonable\nand appropriate conditions, including, but not limited to, conditions for ensuring: (I)  The prompt performance of utility relocation work by either the district, utility\ncompany, or contractor for the transportation expansion plan, as specified in the agreement; (II)  The cooperation of the utility company with the contractor for the transportation\nexpansion plan; and (III)  The payment by the utility company of any damages caused by the company's delay\nin the performance of the relocation work or interference with the performance of the project by\nany other contractor, except when such delay or interference is caused by a force majeure. (4)  All design and construction of utility relocation shall be subject to review and\napproval by district and utility company engineers. (5) (a)  If the district and utility company are unable to reach a fixed guideway corridor\nutility relocation agreement, or if utility relocation disputes arise under an agreement, the district\nand utility company shall each designate an official, at no level lower than district corridor\nproject manager and utility company chief engineer, to resolve the differences. (b)  If the differences cannot be resolved pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection (5),\nutility relocation disputes shall be heard in the following district courts for each of the following\ncorridors and projects: (I)  For union station, Denver county district court; (II)  For the U.S. 36 corridor, Boulder county district court; (III)  For the west corridor, Jefferson county district court; (IV)  For the gold line corridor, Jefferson county district court; (V)  For the east corridor, Denver county district court; (VI)  For the I-225 corridor, Arapahoe county district court; (VII)  For the southwest corridor, Arapahoe county district court; and (VIII)  For the north corridor, Adams county district court. (c)  It shall be presumed that there will be irreparable harm to the public if an injunction\nis not granted to require utility relocation, regardless of a later determination as to which party is\nresponsible for the cost of relocation. (6) (a)  The district shall provide a utility company with detailed maps, drawings, plans,\nand profiles of the district's proposed improvements in each fixed guideway corridor in the\ntransportation expansion plan at: (I)  The conclusion of preliminary engineering; (II)  Sixty percent completion of final design; (III)  The conclusion of final design; and (IV)  Such other times as may be requested by the utility company. (b)  The district shall solicit information as to the location of utility facilities within the\nfixed guideway corridor from the utility company. (c)  For all utilities identified on any documents provided to or in the possession of the\ndistrict, the district shall provide written notice to a utility company as soon as practicable of a\ntransportation expansion plan that will require the relocation of the company's facilities. (d) (I)  Where documents have been in the possession of the district during final design\nof a fixed guideway corridor, the district shall provide notice to a utility company of a\ntransportation expansion plan that will require the relocation of the company's facilities not later\nthan one year before relocation is required for each relocation on each fixed guideway corridor. (II)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (I) of this paragraph (d), if major electrical facilities\nmust be relocated, the district shall provide notice to a utility company at least eighteen months\nin advance of the required relocation date or the district shall pay the cost of any temporary\nrelocation measures required to maintain service to utility customers. If temporary relocation\nmeasures are necessary, such measures shall be provided at the lowest possible cost during\nconstruction and relocation. (III)  For any discovery of utilities during construction that are not identified on\ndocuments provided to or in possession of the district, the district and the utility company shall\nconfer within forty-eight hours of discovery to determine appropriate relocation procedures. (IV)  The district and utility company shall, within ten days of discovery, enter into an\nagreement as to the manner in which any necessary relocation will be accomplished and the\nparty that shall perform the work. (V)  If an agreement is reached and if the utility company performs under the agreement,\nthe utility company shall not be liable for delay damages as provided in subsection (8) of this\nsection. (7) (a)  For purposes of ensuring continuation of required utility services to the residents\nof the district during and after construction of the fixed guideway corridors, the district may\nprovide, and condemn when necessary, replacement easements for the relocation of utilities. If\nsuch replacement easements are necessary, the district shall endeavor to meet any existing\nstandards of the utility for easements. Any necessary condemnation shall be considered a\ntransportation project undertaken by the district. The cost of replacement easements shall be\npaid: (I)  By the district in those instances where the district has acquired, at no extra cost, an\neasement previously owned and occupied by the utility; or (II)  By the utility if the district has compensated the utility for a previously occupied\neasement from which the utility is being relocated. (b)  Notwithstanding any local law to the contrary, aboveground utility facilities shall be\nrelocated aboveground and underground utility facilities shall be relocated underground. To\nminimize the cost of the reconfiguration of the utility facility, the replacement easement shall be\nacquired as close as possible to the original location of the facility that must be relocated. (8) (a)  Where the utility company has elected to perform relocation work or where there\nhas been no agreement reached between a utility company and the district, the utility company\nshall be liable to the district for actual damages suffered by the district as a direct result of the\nutility company's delay in the performance of any utility relocation work or as a direct result of\nthe utility company's interference with the performance of fixed guideway corridor construction\nby other contractors. (b)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection (8), a utility company shall not be\nliable for damages caused by the failure to timely perform the relocation work or the interference\nwith the performance of the transportation expansion plan by another contractor when the failure\nto perform or the interference is caused by a force majeure."

This need is\nmost apparent in the urban drainage and flood control district which encompasses many different\npolitical entities and more than one-half of the entire population of this state. To meet this need,\nit is the intent of the general assembly that a systematic and uniform program of preventive\nmaintenance be instituted and maintained in the district, which program shall be administered by\nthe board of directors of the district and not by local governments."

(2)  The resolution may provide for one or more types of construction, and the engineer\nshall separately estimate the cost of each type of construction. The estimate may be made in a\nlump sum or by unit process, as to such engineer may seem most desirable for the facilities\ncomplete in place.

(6)  In case the assessment is to be upon the abutting property upon a frontage basis, it\nshall be sufficient for the resolution so to state and to define the location of the project to be\nmade. (7)  It shall not be necessary in any case to describe minutely in the resolution each\nparticular tract to be assessed but simply to designate the property, improvement district, or the\nlocation so that the various parts to be assessed can be ascertained and determined to be within\nor without the proposed improvement district. (8)  The engineer shall forthwith prepare and file with the secretary: (a)  The preliminary plans; (b)  The preliminary estimate of cost; and (c)  The assessment plat. (9)  Upon the filing of the plans, preliminary estimate of cost, and plat, the board shall\nexamine the same; and if the plans, estimate, and plat are found to be satisfactory, the board shall\nmake a provisional order by resolution to the effect that the project shall be acquired or\nimproved, or both acquired and improved."

(2) (a)  Whenever the board determines that the interest of the district requires any\nproject to be funded in whole or in part with revenues generated by special assessments, the\nboard, by resolution approved by a supermajority vote as specified in section 32-11.5-204\n(1)(b)(II), shall direct the engineer to prepare: (I)  Preliminary plans showing: (A)  A typical section of the contemplated project; and (B)  The types of material, approximate thickness, and width; (II)  A preliminary estimate of the total cost of the project; and (III)  An assessment plat showing: (A)  The area to be assessed; and (B)  The amount of maximum benefits estimated to be assessed against each tract. (b)  The resolution of the board shall describe the project in general terms but may\nprovide for one or more types of construction, and the engineer shall separately estimate the cost\nof each type of construction. The estimate may be made in a lump sum or by unit process, as\ndeemed most appropriate by the engineer for the completed facilities. (c)  The resolution of the board shall state: (I)  What part or portion of the expense of the described project is of special benefit and\nis to be paid for with revenues generated by special assessments; (II)  What part of the project, if any, has been or is proposed to be funded with revenues\ngenerated from sources other than special assessments; and (III)  The basis by which the cost of the project will be apportioned and special\nassessments will be levied. (d)  In case a special assessment is not to be made according to front feet, the resolution\nof the board shall: (I)  By apt description designate the improvement district, including the tracts to be\nassessed; (II)  Describe definitely the location of the project; and (III)  State that the special assessment is to be made upon all the tracts benefited by the\nproject proportionately to the benefits received. (e)  In case a special assessment is to be upon the abutting property on a frontage basis, it\nshall be sufficient for the resolution so to state and to define the location of the project to be\nmade. (f)  The resolution of the board need not describe in detail each particular tract to be\nassessed but may simply designate the property, improvement district, or location so that the\nvarious tracts to be assessed can be determined to be within the proposed improvement district. (g)  The engineer shall forthwith prepare and file with the district: (I)  The preliminary plans; (II)  The preliminary estimate of cost; and (III)  The assessment plat. (h)  Upon the filing of the plans, preliminary estimate of cost, and plat, the board shall\nexamine the same. If the board finds the plans, estimate, and plat to be satisfactory, it shall make\na provisional order by resolution to the effect that the project shall be acquired, constructed, or\nimproved. (3) (a)  The owner or owners of tracts to be assessed in a proposed improvement district\nfor not less than ninety-five percent of the entire cost of a project, comprising more than fifty\npercent of the area of the proposed improvement district and also comprising a majority of the\nlandowners residing in the proposed improvement district, may, by written petition, initiate the\nacquisition, construction, or improvement of any assessment project that the board is authorized\nto initiate subject to the following limitations: (I)  The board may incorporate the project in one or more existing or alternative proposed\nimprovement districts; (II)  The board is not required to proceed with the construction, acquisition, or\nimprovement of the project or any part thereof if, after holding a provisional order hearing\npursuant to section 32-11.5-507, the board determines that it is not in the public interest for the\nproposed project or part thereof to go forward; and (III)  A particular kind of project, material therefor, or a part thereof need not be\nconstructed, acquired, improved, or located as provided in the petition if the board determines\nthat it is not in the public interest. (b)  The board is not required to take any further action regarding a petition if the board\ndetermines by resolution that the construction, acquisition, or improvement of the proposed\nproject is probably not feasible, the resolution requires a cash deposit or a pledge of property in\nat least an amount designated by the board probably to be sufficient to defray the costs likely to\nbe incurred by the board before and during the attempted acquisition, construction, or\nimprovement of the project designated in the petition, and the deposit or pledge is not provided\nto the board within twenty days after mailed notice is given to the person presenting the petition\nor after one publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the district of a notice of the\nresolution's adoption and of its content in summary form. The board may subsequently, as it\ndeems necessary, require one or more additional deposits or pledges as a condition precedent to\nthe continuation of action by the district. (c)  Whenever a deposit or pledge is made and thereafter the board determines that\nacquisition, construction, or improvement of a project proposed by petition is not feasible within\na reasonable period, the board may require that all or any portion of the costs incurred by the\ndistrict in connection with the petition or project be defrayed from the deposit or proceeds of the\npledged property unless the petitioners or other interested persons defray the costs within twenty\ndays after the board determines the amount to be defrayed by resolution. (d)  Any surplus moneys remaining from a deposit or pledge shall be returned by the\ndistrict to the person making the same.

Orchard Mesa\nIrrigation District,972 P.2d 1037 (Colo. 1998), the Colorado new energy improvement district\nis neither the state nor a local government and therefore is not a district, as defined in section 20\n(2)(b) of article X of the state constitution, subject to the requirements of section 20 of article X\nof the state constitution because: (I)  The district is not authorized to levy general taxes; (II)  Although the district is a public corporation that serves the public purposes of\npromoting new energy improvements and creating jobs, it does not have elected board members\nand primarily exists to serve the interests of owners of eligible real property who voluntarily join\nthe district in order to fund new energy improvements to the property; and (III)  The district is endowed by the state pursuant to this article with only the powers\nnecessary to perform its predominantly private objective; (b)  There is no legal impediment to the imposition of special assessments and the\nissuance of special assessment bonds without an election by an entity like the Colorado new\nenergy improvement district that is formed by law, has statewide jurisdiction, and is governed by\nan appointed board; (c)  The burden of a special assessment is voluntarily assumed by the owner of the\neligible real property on which the special assessment is levied because: (I)  A special assessment may only be levied on eligible real property if the owner of the\nproperty has voluntarily joined the district, agreed to accept reimbursement or a direct payment,\nand consented to the levy of a special assessment; and (II)  A subsequent purchaser of eligible real property upon which a special assessment\nhas been levied purchases the property with full knowledge of the special assessment; and (d)  Both an owner of eligible real property who joins the district and receives\nreimbursement or a direct payment and any subsequent owner of the property receive the special\nbenefit of the new energy improvement for which the district has made reimbursement or a\ndirect payment in proportion to or in excess of the amount of the special assessment paid."

(7)  Failure to pay any installment on special assessments, whether of principal or\ninterest, when due gives the district the right to declare the installments delinquent, and upon\nsuch a declaration the whole amount of the unpaid principal and accrued interest shall thereafter\ndraw interest at the same rate as delinquent property taxes as specified in section 39-10-104.5\n(3)(c), C.R.S.

    "content": " (1) (a)  A special assessment, together with all interest thereon and penalties for\ndefault in payment thereof, and associated collection costs constitutes, from the date of the\nrecording of the assessing resolution and assessment roll pursuant to subsection (2) of this\nsection, a perpetual lien in the amount assessed against the assessed eligible real property and\nhas priority over all other liens; except that: (I)  General property tax liens have priority over district special assessment liens; (II)  A district special assessment lien has priority over preexisting liens only if each\nlienholder consents as specified in section 32-20-105 (3)(i) and each consent and the special\nassessment lien and special assessment roll are recorded in the real estate records of the county\nwhere the property is located. Before the recording of the special assessment lien and special\nassessment roll, the applicant must submit to the district: (A)  Written consent to the special assessment by all individuals or entities shown on a\ncommitment of title insurance as holders of mortgages or deeds of trust encumbering the\napplicant's property; and (B)  Evidence that there are no delinquent taxes, special assessments, or water or sewer\ncharges on the property; that the property is not subject to a trust deed or other lien on which\nthere is a recorded notice of default, foreclosure, or delinquency that has not been cured; and that\nthere are no involuntary liens, including a lien on real property or on the proceeds of a contract\nrelating to real property, for services, labor, or materials furnished in connection with the\nconstruction or improvement of the property. (III)  Liens for assessments imposed by other governmental entities have coequal priority\nwith district special assessment liens. (b)  Neither the sale of eligible real property or tax liens in the district to enforce the\npayment of general ad valorem taxes nor the issuance of a treasurer's deed in connection with the\nsale extinguishes the lien of a special assessment. If assessed eligible real property is subdivided,\nthe board may apportion the special assessment lien in the manner provided in the assessing\nresolution. (2)  The district shall transmit to a county clerk and recorder of a county that includes\neligible real property included in the district copies of the district's assessing resolution after its\nfinal adoption by the board and the assessment roll for recording on the land records of each unit\nof eligible real property assessed within the county as provided in article 30, 35, or 36 of title 38,\nC.R.S. The assessing resolution and assessment roll shall be indexed in the grantor index under\nthe name of the district member and in the grantee index under the Colorado new energy\nimprovement district. In addition, the county clerk and recorder shall file copies of the assessing\nresolution, after its final adoption by the board, and the assessment roll with the county assessor\nand the county treasurer. The county assessor is authorized to create separate schedules for each\nunit of eligible real property assessed within the county pursuant to the resolution. (3)  No delays, mistakes, errors, or irregularities in any act or proceeding authorized or\nrequired by this article shall prejudice or invalidate any final special assessment, and such\nmistakes, errors, or irregularities may be remedied by subsequent filings, amending acts, or\nproceedings. A remedied special assessment takes effect as of the date of the original filing, act,\nor proceeding. If a court of competent jurisdiction sets aside any final assessment or if, for any\nother reason, the board determines it to be necessary to alter any final special assessment, the\nboard, upon notice as required in the making of an original special assessment, may make a new\nspecial assessment in accordance with the provisions of this article. (4) (a)  In case of default in the payment of any installment of principal or interest when\ndue, the county treasurer shall advertise and sell the assessed eligible real property tax lien\ndefaulted upon for the payment of the whole of the unpaid installment of principal and interest.\nAdvertisements and sales shall be made at the same times, in the same manner, under all the\nsame conditions and penalties, and with the same effect as provided by general law for sales of\nreal property tax liens in default of payment of the general property tax. (b)  At any tax lien sale by a county treasurer of any eligible real property, the board may\nparticipate in the tax lien sale auction by bidding on the lien for the district and receive\ncertificates of purchase for the lien in the name of the district if it is the successful bidder. The\ncertificates shall be received and credited at their face value, with all interest and penalties\naccrued, on account of the assessment installment in pursuance of which the sale was made. The\nboard may thereafter sell the certificates at their face value, with all interest and penalties\naccrued, and assign the certificates to the purchaser in the name of the district. The board shall\ncredit the proceeds of the sale to the fund created by resolution for the payment of the special\nassessments, respectively; except that, if the new energy improvements were financed under\nsection 32-20-105 (3)(h), the board shall credit the proceeds of the tax lien sale to the private\nthird party that financed the new energy improvements. If the district has repaid all special\nassessment bonds in full, the board may sell the certificates for the best price obtainable at public\nsale, at auction, or by sealed bids in the same manner and under the same conditions as provided\nin paragraph (d) of this subsection (4). Such assignments are without recourse, and the sale and\nassignments operate as a lien in favor of the purchaser and assignee as is provided by law in the\ncase of sale of real estate in default of payment of the general property taxes. (c)  The board, as a purchaser of tax liens, has the right to apply for tax deeds on\ncertificates of purchase at any time after three years from the date of issuance of the certificates\nin accordance with article 11 of title 39, C.R.S., and the deeds shall be issued as provided by law\nfor issuance of tax deeds for the nonpayment of the general property taxes or special\nassessments. (d)  Cumulatively with all other remedies, the district, as the owner of property by virtue\nof a tax deed, may sell the property for the best price obtainable at public sale, at auction, or by\nsealed bids. A sale shall be held after public notice by the board to all persons having or claiming\nany interest in the eligible real property to be sold or in the proceeds of the sale by publication of\nthe notice three times, a week apart, in a weekly or daily newspaper of general circulation within\nthe county in which the property is located. The notice shall describe the property and state the\ntime, place, and manner of receiving bids; except that the time fixed for the sale shall not be less\nthan ten days after the last publication. The board may reject any and all bids. Any interested\nparty, at any time within ten days after the receipt of bids for the sale of property, may file with\nthe board a written protest as to the sufficiency of the amount of any bid made or the validity of\nthe proceedings for the sale. If the protest is denied, the protestor, within ten days thereafter,\nshall commence an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin or restrain the board\nfrom completing the sale. If no such action is commenced, all protests or objections to the sale\nshall be waived, and the board shall then convey the property to the successful bidder by\nquitclaim deed. (e)  Repealed. (f)  The board shall credit the proceeds of any sale of property to the appropriate special\nassessment fund; except that, if the new energy improvements were financed under section\n32-20-105 (3)(h), the board shall credit the proceeds of the sale to the private third party that\nfinanced the new energy improvements. The district shall deduct from the appropriate special\nassessment fund the necessary expenses in securing deeds and taking proceedings for the sale or\nforeclosure. (g)  If a treasurer's deed is issued for a property that is included within the district\npursuant to section 32-20-105 and upon which a priority special assessment lien has been placed,\nthe district shall use its reserve account to satisfy special assessment obligations of the property\non behalf of the holder of the treasurer's deed in accordance with the terms and duration\nspecified in a written agreement between the county in which the property is located and the\ndistrict. (5)  When the district has sold or conveyed at a fair market value certificates of purchase\nor property that the district has acquired in satisfaction or discharge of special assessment liens,\nthe sales and conveyances are hereby validated and confirmed as against all parties having or\nclaiming any interest in the property or sale proceeds. Cross references:In 2013, subsections (1), (2), (4)(b), and (4)(f) were amended by the\n\"New Energy Jobs Act of 2013\".
